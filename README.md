# Pytorch Dog Breed Classification Project

## Introduction
This is an dog image classification project using Pytorch. In this project, I use tranfer learning technique to employ the well-trained CNN feature extraction layers from VGG16, and then built and trained a self-defined linear classifier.

## Result
The model accuracy is around 80%. 

## Modules Used
* torch
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* glob
* torchvision
* PIL
* cv2

## Files Included in this repository

* dog_app.py (This is the training script)
* haarcascade_...xml (This is downloaded from the internet to recognize human face)

## Usage
Try to download all the files in the same directory before using this script for testing your own images.
